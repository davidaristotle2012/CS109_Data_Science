#  CS109 DATA SCIENCE
In this Git repo, I have put my resources from [Harvard's 2015 CS109 class](http://cs109.github.io/2015/). This class was recommened at Quora and a few other places as being a very good resource for practical data science. , so here goes. My notes are here in the readme file as I work through the [course syllabus](http://cs109.github.io/2015/pages/schedule.html)
